  <i>A simple and delicious pasta dish from Italy.</i>
  <br>

  <p>Pax servings: 2</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pasta (2 servings)</li>
    <li>Garlic cloves (2)</li>
    <li>Mixed italian herbs</li>
    <li>Chilli flakes</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil <i>(optional)</i> </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Chop up the garlic cloves. (You can smash them too to easily get the skin out)</li>
    <li>Boil the pasta up with salt to about 70% of the time stated on the packet. We want it to be al-dante.</li>
    <li>While waiting, take a pot and heat up some olive oil and all the garlic in medium heat. We want to ensure that
      theres ample olive oil such that the garlic floats alittle.</li>
    <li>Wait for about 3 minutes for it to the garlic to show signs of slight browning. At this stage, we should wait
      and see until theres some slight browning. Once u see it turn off the heat.</li>
    <li>Add italian herbs, chilli flakes, pepper and salt into the garlic olive oil to taste.</li>
    <li>If you notice that theres not enough olive oil, add extra virgin olive oil. Its gives it a more complex flavour.
    </li>
    <li>By now your pasta should be done, turn off the heat and strain the pasta. Keep some of the pasta water as it is
      important to add some flavour profile when we combine the pasta and the garlic oil together.</li>
    <li>When ready to serve, add the pasta, some pasta water and garlic oil into a pot and start cooking them up.</li>
    <li>Cook for the remaining 30% of the time from the pasta packet. Turn off the heat and serve.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
